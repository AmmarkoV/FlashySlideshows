TODO LIST - THOUGHT DUMP :P
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

* Organize code , and make a memory hypervisor ( or something ) 

* Monitor all mallocs / frees and pass them to frame.gpu and frame.system values

* Implement a real loading mechanism that loads/unloads textures to provide seamless slideshows on low RAM GPUs

* Implement frame scaling to fill thumbnails with small textures faster

* Implement frame scaling to lower the maximum resolution to fit more things in RAM where RAM is scarce   

* Implement a "plugin" system for effects , each picture position , next / last picture changed according to plugin layout

* Add effects ( shiny floor , transparency , particles ) to images

* Fix Directory issues , find out where to install program in order for it to load default textures correctly 

* Make a real implementation of directory listing.cpp :P
