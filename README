Flashy Slide Show
----------------------

21/3/2012
This project is now approximately 4.5k loc and has taken me 3+ months of development time..!
Since it meets my "photography" needs as it is I decided to pause it once again to concentrate on other projects :P .. Overall it is pretty stable , useful and I have done a good job profiling code and taken performance seriously while building it... 
If someone wants a particular feature or has a bug fix , etc , you are welcome to contact me so that it will be added or fixed..
