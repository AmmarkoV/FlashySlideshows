Flashy Slide Show
----------------------
 
This project is now approximately 4.5k loc and has taken me 3+ months of development time..!
Since it meets my "photography" needs as it is I decided to pause it once again to concentrate on other projects :P .. Overall it is pretty stable , useful and I have done a good job profiling code and taken performance seriously while building it... 
If someone wants a particular feature or has a bug fix , etc , you are welcome to add it on the issues tracker ( https://github.com/AmmarkoV/FlashySlideshows/issues ) so that it may be added or fixed..
